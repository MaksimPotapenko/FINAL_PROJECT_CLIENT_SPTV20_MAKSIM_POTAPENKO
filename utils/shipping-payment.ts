export const tab1Text = `The Omniva courier service in Estonia provides delivery of various goods and postal items throughout the country. Typically, a user places an order with a store or sender and provides a delivery address. The store or sender then packages the goods and hands them over to the Omniva delivery service. Omniva can deliver the parcel either to a parcel locker or to the recipient's specified address, depending on the choice made when placing the order. Approximately at the time of delivery, the recipient usually receives a notification via SMS or email with information about the readiness of the parcel for collection. The recipient visits the parcel locker or waits for delivery to their address and retrieves their parcel using a unique code (if it's a parcel locker). Omniva also offers additional services such as parcel insurance, parcel storage services in parcel lockers, and others.`
